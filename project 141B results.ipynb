So as the students graduated from statistic major or proficient with data analysis, most parts of us are interested in looking for jobs that has the “Data analysts” positions. In order to help students get more information when they are looking for these jobs, we contribute to study the relationship of students’ job demands and the companies’ requirements. Like what are the data analysts’ required skills and what statistics characteristics they have. Our project motivation is to help students to examine whether they are qualified to be a data analyst and which skills they should cultivated to be better prepared."

Our project is to analyze the base requirements of the data analysts, such as what kind of soft wares, programming languages and models that the famous companies needed. And then we find every posts’ URL. According to the web scripting, we get their locations and companies information. On base of regression expression, we take the posts’ requirements data directly. And then we process and clean the data we grabbed from total requirements get the data analysts required skills and sort them. We calculate the term frequency and analyze the statistics characteristics by visualization. And then get our conclusion to guide students to get the information about what kind of jobs matched their background and technologies best and can help them evaluate the success rate of applying this position."
